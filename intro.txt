This Docker image contains the prototype developed by Vincent Lunot for the 
MolHack 2019 competition.

The code for generating SMILES is in the `src` directory.  
The problem and model specifications are in the `specs` directory.  
The data used for training and testing is in the `data` directory.  
The generated SMILES are stored in the `res` directory.

Execute:
- `./run_all.sh` to run the entire generation process,
- `./preprocess.sh` to run the preprocessing step,
- `./train.sh` to train the model (requires the preprocessing files),
- `./generate.sh` to generate the SMILES (requires the training files),
- `./clean_all.sh` to delete all computed results.
